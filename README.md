This is a collaborative project between Emma Li and Nathan Xie
intended to gain experience in Machine Learning using PyTorch
and other libraries. We will study documentation
of projects with similar concepts before applying these concepts
to each goal. For example, we will first learn the classic MNIST
Handwritten Digit Classification before attempting the CIFAR-10
Image Classification on our own.

:fire: Goals :fire:
